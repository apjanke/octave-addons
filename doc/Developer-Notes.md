octave-addons Developer Notes
=============================

# Overall TODO

* Convert to GNU code style
* Stick a license header on all the files?
* Report the Octave crash that happens when I'm in a file stopped in the debugger, make changes to that file, and save it with Cmd-S while it's still stopped in the debugger. The changes to the file do not appear, so the crash happens before the write hits the disk.
  * This crash seems to be gone in 4.4.1
* Add BISTs

* Add a dispstr() API package?
